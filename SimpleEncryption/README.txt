IMPORTANT!!

#This is a simple attempt by me to implement a cipher type algorithm to encode text 
#It does not support any other format except .txt files in ANSI encoding
#Unicode is not supported and may cause undefined behaviour
#Please use a copy of your data and test both scripts before use, to prevent dataloss due to any undiscovered bugs

Consists of 2 scripts 
decryp.py
encryp.py

1.Simply name the file to be encrypted as "target.txt" and place it in the same folder as the scripts
2.execute the encryp.py script through your terminal
3.script will make a "key.txt" and encode "target.txt"
4.execute "decryp.py" with "key.txt" present in the same folder to decode the text
